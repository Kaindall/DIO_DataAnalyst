# Overview

This repository has made to deposit all projects did during the DIO's Data Analyst course by Unimed BH. See below details about all of them:

### Pandas
It's a basic project that I learned how to use Pandas, Numpy and other libraries of visualization like Seaborn and Matplotlib to do some analysis and recover core informations about a lot of stores selling a lot of things.

### Covid Prediction
This project naturally evolved from previous project (Pandas) with other database and some foresight with AI and I made some visualization with official information about the evolution and growth rate of Covid 19, the tools used to do it was Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib (with Pyplot) and alternatively Plotly.
We also foresight some results of the sickness (in a basic case that nothing changes) with Sklearn, pdarima and prophet.

### Machine Learning of Cat & Dog
In this project we made an entire training of an Artificial Intelligence to teach it how to see the difference between a cat and dog, using a repository with more than 5000 different images to do it. So, we can put a image and ask if it's a cat or dog to get the correct answer.

### Mechanical & eCommerce Schema
In the both projects I made alone an entire database about two different areas of services, covering so much detail I can remember to put in my schema. I used all steps of making a entire database from nothing.

### Released Package
It's a project that I just published on Pypi library an empty library to other user of Python, just to learn.
